# PN Engineering Datasets

High-quality, AI-ready datasets of **real structural engineering drawings**  
created by a professional structural engineer with **15+ years of experience** in Germany (Tragwerksplanung, Statik).

## 💡 What I provide

Datasets based on real reinforced concrete (RC) design drawings, cleaned and prepared for:

- 🧠 OCR & Computer Vision  
- 🏗️ CAD / BIM automation  
- 🔎 Technical drawing interpretation  
- 📚 Civil & structural engineering education  
- 🤖 Multimodal / LLM training (vision + text)

All datasets are:

- anonymized (no project/client data)  
- flattened (PDFs safe for AI processing)  
- exported to **1200 DPI PNG**  
- consistently named and documented (README, Data Dictionary, License, JSON metadata)

## 📦 Available dataset families

- **RC_Columns_V1** – reinforced concrete columns  
- **RC_Walls_V1 / V2** – RC walls with sections and details  
- **RC_Beams_V1** – RC beams with reinforcement layouts  
- **RC_Foundations_V1** – RC foundations & footings  
- **RC_PrecastColumns_V1** – precast RC column detailing  

Each full dataset typically includes:

- PDF drawings (flattened, cleaned)  
- PNG exports (1200 DPI)  
- README + Data Dictionary + License  
- Metadata (JSON / CSV)
